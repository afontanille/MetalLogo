# Metal logo

This repository holds the sample code written in Swift for a reproduction of the Metal API logo designed by Apple, drawn using the MetalKit framework. The code is inspired by and also contains some of the code from the book [_Metal by Example_][1] by Warren Moore.

You can run the project on OS X, iOs, tvOS on a big screen ðŸ˜Ž and in a Playground, thanks to this [blog post][2] by Marius Horga.
